    In December of 2017, I travelled to [Fiji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji), a country comprised of many islands in the South Pacific. The biggest island, called *Viti Levu*, is where I spendt most of my time in Fiji, followed by a week or so on Drawaqa, a small island in the Yasawa group of Islands.

# Lessons Learned: Disclaimer
This was my first big international trip, so lots of life lessons learned. My travel partner was a lot less prepared than I was thinking they would be, and I quickly learned that I was expected to be the provider, the planner, the forecaster, the caregiver, the tour guide, etc. Despite the workload that comes along with those roles, I still had a blast.

The story starts in the Los Angeles LAX airport:
## Lesson 1: Know the Airport.
Always know where your upcoming departure gate is and give yourself extra time to get there.

I am usually a *stop and smell the flowers* type of guy. I'll gladly change my plans if it means an authentic experience is to be had. Sometimes, I can be a little too laxidazical, and this was on full display when we deplaned in LAX and, prior to figuring out where our next departure gate was, I chose to glance through the shops in the airport (with absolutely no intention of buying a single thing).

It turns out that the Tom Bradley *international* terminal at LAX, at least as of 2017, is not accessible from the other terminals at LAX. Instead of mozeying down to our gate as planned, the process was more involved. We needed to:
1. Exit through security;
2. Get our bags from the baggage claim;
3. Go outside and walk down the street to the *international* terminal;
5. Start the process as we had just arrived to the airport by car.

The added steps were unexpected and we were on a bit of a time crunch due to my dilly-dalying. However, there was still time to stop and smell the flowers. As we walked into the Tom Bradley international terminal, the whole ambiance of checking in was magical. A gigantic departure board hung overhead, clicking away as the flights and times adjusted. Loads of international travel seems to depart from LAX at night, so the check-in area was packed with people from nearly every country on the planet. The roaring white noise from everyone talking was seemingly silent as hundreds of different languages filled the air. You can't help but to stop and take it all in. It's fun to people watch and imagine all of the things that people may be traveling for. For instance, we were waiting to be on holiday, but others could easily be on their journey to get home, or they could be going on a business trip, moving, maybe even going to see a loved one who could be ill. It's truly remarkable that air travel enables so many goals to be accomplished for humans all over the world.

Of course, my frustrated and anxious travel partner made sure I stayed on track to get us checked in and through security. 

So, the takeway: Make a plan, bunt dont be too worried about sticking to the plan. Among others, Eisenhower once said, *"No plan survives first contact with the enemy."* Though travel isn't the enemy, the point is that it's important to be flexible so you can enjoy the journey. 

## Lesson 2: Check the weather.
We board the plane, get situated in our seats, and the excitement sets in. The seatback screen on the chair ahead of us is displaying a map with a disproportionately sized plane shown hovering over California and a dashed line tracing the whopping 12 hour flight path all the way to Fiji. The moment is finally here; The next stop is Fiji.

All the passengers are now on the plane and, as usual, the flight attendants are feverishly playing tetris with the overhead bin space. The pilot clicks the intercomm and announces *"... due to the tropical depression, we have to take on more fuel, so we are needing a couple of volunteers to stay in LA for the night and catch the flight into Fiji tomorrow."* I should have been asking what a tropical depression is, because I had no clue what that meant. Instead, since I was bankrolling the trip for me and my travel partner, who was notoriously inflexible. After ten minutes go by, the pilot again made the same announcement. I said to my travel partner, *"We really ought to consider taking the money and trimming one day off of the itinerary."* Afterall, the plans for the trip were far from rigid and a single day wouldn't have inconvenienced us at all. Another twenty minutes or so go by and the pilot comes on the intercom again, this time to say, *"...Okay, since no one wants to volunteer, we will be taking bags off the plane instead... click."*

Yeah, you're on the right track... , I wouldnt be telling you all of this if my bag made the flight, right? Right. 

I arrived in Fiji both learning that i'd be without my clothes for a few days and, uhm, what a tropical depression actually is. The first few days in Fiji were full of rain, land slides, muddy ocean water, ... you get the picture. I should have learned what a Tropical depression meant, maybe I would have stayinf in LA for an extra day or two and cut the trip costs in half! Lesson learned.

## Lesson 3: Don't be cheap; Be frugal.
I decided to hire a car for the trip. I looked into things before the trip and learned that in Fiji, rental cars and Taxi's are identifiable by yellow license plates and the rental cars have a gigantic red R displayed in teh windshield. Also, rental cars can be expensive. I decided to be cheap and pay someone to use their personal car while I was in Fiji. It didn't go well. It didnt go bad, but it didn't go well.

## Lesson 4: It's okay to splurge. 

# The fun stuff!

It was practically my last week in Fiji. I found myself craving that *bougie* Fiji. You know, the bungalo over the crystal clear water, Fiji. The *money is no object*, Fiji.

Well, for me, money absolutely was an object, so I got creative. I found an authentic experience at [BareFoot Manta](https://www.barefootmantafiji.com/); no electricity, no mainstream amenities, just the beautiful island and the guest staying in one of 21 open air rooms. It was a quaint experience and truly gave me the exact experience I was hoping for. 

The island hosts two researchers doing marine conservation and they double as dive guides on the island. I went on six dives during my week on the island, each of which was intimate with only one or two other divers. The diving was pristine, with coral rich waters full of sea life like I had never seen before.
