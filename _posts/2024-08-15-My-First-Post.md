This is my first post by creating a new file from scratch. I am excited to learn how to use Github Pages to create a website that is personal to me. 

I plan to use this website both for personal and professional use.
I will share publications of mine and my colleagues as well as personal projects and insight into my life outside of academia/work. 



#Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

#```ruby
#def print_hi(name)
#  puts "Hi, #{name}"
#end
#print_hi('Tom')
##=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
#```

#Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
