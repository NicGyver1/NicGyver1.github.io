## Chester
Chester joined my life in the summer of 2018. I had a trip planned to visit my sister who was temporarily living in Oklahoma. I found a breeder nearby to my sister who had a pup for saleand I inquired about the little guy. The breeder sent me photos and explained his personality a bit. Once I arrived in oklahoma, my sister and her daughter joined me in going to meet the pup. He was so tiny, soft and cuddly. We arranged to pick him up the day before I started my road trip back home.

I remember being so scared after picking him up, thinking that I would not be responsible enough for the pup. Now, many years later, I can donfidently say that it was the best decision I could have made. Chester has been my very best companion helping me get through the difficult moments in life.

Chester is almost always up for playing ball. Fetch is his job and he is a dedicated worker. Once he starts, there's no stopping him from going for hours on end! If he is ready for a break, he will stop on his way back from getting the ball and lay down for a bit, catching his breath. Moments later, hes ready to go again! In the winter months, when its terribly cold outside, we will play fetch with soft rubber tennis balls inside.

Car rides are a blast for Chester. Of course, like most doggo's, he loves having the windows down. He will stick his cute little nose out the window and continuously sniff, practically sending sneez-stuff beck inside the car! I made a bed that attaches to the center console for when he was smaller. It was a lifesaver for a couple of long road trips. Now that he is a bit bigger, he prefers sitting in my lap as I drive.

Chester is a loyal pup who gets lots of compliments as we are out and about. Both for his cuteness but also his calm nature and obedience.

It's a shame that doggos have much shorter lives than humans. And for that, I try my best to give him every bit of attention he deserves, and more! 

### His brother, Toka.
For a few years, Chester had a big-little brother, Toka. I say big-little because Toka is a few years younger than Chester but he grew to be about double Chester's size.

Toka is an australian shepherd as well and has a *"red tri"* coat with gorgeous, humongous brown eyes. Even though his papers state taht he is a red-tri, his light brown colors never really came through. 

Toka is a rambunctious boy who gives the best snuggles, but only if you can get them. He is a floppy boy who is very independent so he doesnt sit still or snuggle much, unless he is very tired. There was a pattern with his energy, where he would have a very hyper day, then a very tired lazy day, then back to being hyper. This went on for a couple of years! He loves to get into everything. When groceries come in the door, he routinely shoves his head into every single bag, no matter what is inside of it. He's very curious and not affraid to get into his fair share of mischief.

Toka grew to be about double the size of Chester, and he isnt the most aware of his size. Toka frequently bumps into Chester at full speed or accidentally trample Chester. For the 
most part, Chester was really good at forgivving Toka, though he made sure to be the alpha doggo!

Unfortunately, Chester and Toka were separated when my first wife decided marriage wasn't for her. It took awhile for Chester to re-adjust to being an only fur-child, and its apparent he still misses his brother dearly.
