## Chester
Chester joined my life in the summer of 2018. I had a trip planned to visit my sister who was temporarily living in Oklahoma. I found a breeder nearby to my sister who had a pup for sale
and I inquired about the little guy. The breeder sent me photos and explained his personality a bit. Once I arrived in oklahoma, my sister and her daughter joined me in going to meet the 
pup. He was so tiny, soft and cuddly. We arranged to pick him up the day before I started my road trip back home.\

I remember being so scared after picking him up, thinking that I would not be responsible enough for the pup. Now, many years later, It was the best decision i could have made. Chester is 
my best friend and has helped me to get through some difficult moments in life. \

Its a shame that doggos have much shorter lives than humans. And for that, I try my best to give him every bit of attention he deserves, and more! 

### His brother, Toka.
For a few years, Chester had a big-little brother, Toka. He is a *"red tri"* australian shepherd, though his light brown colors never really came through. He is a rambunctous boy who
givees the best snuggles. He is a floppy boy who is very independent but loves to get into everything. He's very curious and not affraid to get in his fair share of mischeif.\

Toka grew to be about double the size of Chester, and he wasnt the most aware of his size. He would frequently bump into chester at full speed or accidentally trample Chester. For the 
most part, Chester was really good at forgivving Toka, though he made sure to be the alpha doggo!\

Unfortunately, Chester and Toka were separated when my first wife decided marriage wasn't for her. It took awhile for chester to re-adjust to being an only fur-child, and its apparent he 
still misses his brother dearly.
